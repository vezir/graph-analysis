closeness centrality, or average shortest path length, lower values indicate more central nodes

Betweenness centrality is a widely used measure that captures a person's role in allowing information to pass from one part of the network to the other.
Technically, it measures the percentage of shortest paths that must go through the specific node. 

Hyperlink-Induced Topic Search (HITS; also known as hubs and authorities) is a link analysis algorithm that rates Web pages
a good hub represents a page that pointed to many other pages, while a good authority represents a page that is linked by many different hubs.[1]
The scheme therefore assigns two scores for each page: its authority, which estimates the value of the content of the page, and its hub value, which estimates the value of its links to other pages.
